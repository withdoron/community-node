## DEC-092: Construction Gate + Mandatory Admin Surface (2026-03-26)

**Decision:** Every new feature ships behind a construction gate (`{false && <Component />}`) until it passes a walkthrough with Doron. Additionally, every user-facing feature must have a corresponding admin surface (even if read-only) so the gardener can see what's happening across all workspaces.

**Rationale:** Features that ship without walkthrough validation create hidden bugs and UX debt. Features without admin visibility create blind spots for the platform operator. The construction gate pattern is cheap to implement and easy to remove — one line change from `false` to `true`.

**Implementation:** Added as Phase 8 in BUILD-PROTOCOL. All 15 phases are now numbered 0-14.

## DEC-093: Base44 Entity Changes Via Agent Prompt (2026-03-26)

**Decision:** All entity creation, field additions, and permission changes are done via Base44 agent prompts (markdown files in `base44-prompts/` directory), not manually in the dashboard. The Claude Code prompt includes a PRE-REQUISITE note referencing the agent prompt.

**Rationale:** Manual dashboard entity changes are error-prone (typos, forgotten fields, wrong permissions) and not version-controlled. Agent prompts are reviewable, reproducible, and documented. Base44's AI assistant can also revert manual permission changes when asked to set security via schema files.

**Implementation:** Documented in CLAUDE.md. Prompt files stored in `base44-prompts/` directory.

## DEC-094: One Agent Per Space (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** Every space in the garden can have its own Superagent — an AI assistant that lives inside the space and serves its users. Agent naming convention: `[SpaceName]Agent`. Agents are READ-ONLY on workspace entities (except ServiceFeedback for feedback capture). Chat UI is a reusable AgentChat component.

**Rationale:** The agent is the space's nervous system. It answers questions, guides users through workflows, looks up information, and collects feedback. What's true of one space's agent is true of all spaces' agents — the fractal principle.

**Implementation:** First agent: FieldServiceAgent (shipped 2026-03-27). AgentChat.jsx + AgentChatButton.jsx are reusable across all spaces via `agentName` prop.

## DEC-095: asServiceRole Does NOT Bypass Creator Only (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** In Base44, `asServiceRole` in server functions does NOT bypass "Creator Only" Update permissions on entities. Entity Update permission must be set to "No restrictions" for server function updates to work.

**Rationale:** Discovered during e-sign implementation. The signDocument server function used `asServiceRole` to update FSDocument, but the entity had "Creator Only" Update permission. The update silently failed. Changed FSDocument and FSEstimate Update permissions to "No restrictions."

**Implementation:** Documented in CLAUDE.md Base44 SDK Quirks section.

## DEC-096: Request Signature Is One Action (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** "Send for Signature" is a single click that generates a portal token, copies the signing link to clipboard, and updates the document/estimate status. Not a two-step process (generate link then copy separately).

**Rationale:** Contractors are in the field with one hand free. Every extra tap is friction. The link goes to clipboard immediately — they paste it into a text message to their client.

---

## DEC-097: Documents Grouped by Client (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** The Field Service documents tab displays documents grouped by client name as section headers, not as a flat list. Client selection is required during document creation.

**Rationale:** A contractor thinks in terms of "Johnson's documents" not "document #47." Grouping by client matches the mental model. Required client selection prevents orphaned documents.

---

## DEC-098: Post-Signature Invitation (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** After a client signs a document or estimate, show a construction-gated invitation to create a LocalLane account ("See my documents & projects") or start their own business on LocalLane. This is an organism growth mechanism.

**Rationale:** Every signed document is a real relationship entering the garden. The post-signature moment is when the client is most engaged — offer them the door in.
