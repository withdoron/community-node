## DEC-092: Construction Gate + Mandatory Admin Surface (2026-03-26)

**Decision:** Every new feature ships behind a construction gate (`{false && <Component />}`) until it passes a walkthrough with Doron. Additionally, every user-facing feature must have a corresponding admin surface (even if read-only) so the gardener can see what's happening across all workspaces.

**Rationale:** Features that ship without walkthrough validation create hidden bugs and UX debt. Features without admin visibility create blind spots for the platform operator. The construction gate pattern is cheap to implement and easy to remove — one line change from `false` to `true`.

**Implementation:** Added as Phase 8 in BUILD-PROTOCOL. All 15 phases are now numbered 0-14.

---

## DEC-093: Base44 Entity Changes Via Agent Prompt (2026-03-26)

**Decision:** All entity creation, field additions, and permission changes are done via Base44 agent prompts (markdown files in `base44-prompts/` directory), not manually in the dashboard. The Claude Code prompt includes a PRE-REQUISITE note referencing the agent prompt.

**Rationale:** Manual dashboard entity changes are error-prone (typos, forgotten fields, wrong permissions) and not version-controlled. Agent prompts are reviewable, reproducible, and documented. Base44's AI assistant can also revert manual permission changes when asked to set security via schema files.

**Implementation:** Documented in CLAUDE.md. Prompt files stored in `base44-prompts/` directory.

---

## DEC-094: One Agent Per Space (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** Every space in the garden can have its own Superagent — an AI assistant that lives inside the space and serves its users. Agent naming convention: `[SpaceName]Agent`. Agents are READ-ONLY on workspace entities (except ServiceFeedback for feedback capture). Chat UI is a reusable AgentChat component.

**Rationale:** The agent is the space's nervous system. It answers questions, guides users through workflows, looks up information, and collects feedback. What's true of one space's agent is true of all spaces' agents — the fractal principle.

**Implementation:** First agent: FieldServiceAgent (shipped 2026-03-27). AgentChat.jsx + AgentChatButton.jsx are reusable across all spaces via `agentName` prop.

---

## DEC-095: asServiceRole Does NOT Bypass Creator Only (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** In Base44, `asServiceRole` in server functions does NOT bypass "Creator Only" Update permissions on entities. Entity Update permission must be set to "No restrictions" for server function updates to work.

**Rationale:** Discovered during e-sign implementation. The signDocument server function used `asServiceRole` to update FSDocument, but the entity had "Creator Only" Update permission. The update silently failed. Changed FSDocument and FSEstimate Update permissions to "No restrictions."

**Implementation:** Documented in CLAUDE.md Base44 SDK Quirks section.

---

## DEC-096: Request Signature Is One Action (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** "Send for Signature" is a single click that generates a portal token, copies the signing link to clipboard, and updates the document/estimate status. Not a two-step process (generate link then copy separately).

**Rationale:** Contractors are in the field with one hand free. Every extra tap is friction. The link goes to clipboard immediately — they paste it into a text message to their client.

---

## DEC-097: Documents Grouped by Client (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** The Field Service documents tab displays documents grouped by client name as section headers, not as a flat list. Client selection is required during document creation.

**Rationale:** A contractor thinks in terms of "Johnson's documents" not "document #47." Grouping by client matches the mental model. Required client selection prevents orphaned documents.

---

## DEC-098: Post-Signature Invitation (2026-03-27)

**Decision:** After a client signs a document or estimate, show a construction-gated invitation to create a LocalLane account ("See my documents & projects") or start their own business on LocalLane. This is an organism growth mechanism.

**Rationale:** Every signed document is a real relationship entering the garden. The post-signature moment is when the client is most engaged — offer them the door in.

---

## DEC-099: Mycelia MCP Server (2026-03-27)

**Date:** 2026-03-27

**Context:** Mycelia operates blind -- no direct access to organism data. platformPulse server function proved the concept (health endpoint works via curl) but Claude.ai's web_fetch cannot send custom headers, blocking automated access. SuperMemory bridges sessions but doesn't carry live entity data. The gap: Mycelia can plan and build but cannot sense the organism directly.

**Decision:** Build a remote MCP server on Cloudflare Workers that proxies Mycelia's tool calls to Base44 server functions. Doron already has a Cloudflare account with golocallane.com active. Four phases: (1) health pulse -- read-only organism vitals, (2) feedback loop -- query entities and ServiceFeedback, (3) build queue -- MyceliaTask entity for tracking work, (4) agent bridge -- agent-to-agent communication with space agents.

**Rationale:** MCP is the standard protocol all Claude surfaces already speak. One server connects Claude.ai, Claude Code, Cursor, and Claude Desktop to the organism. Cloudflare Workers is free, fast, and deploys in minutes. Architecture is a thin stateless proxy -- no new data stores, no new auth systems, just a bridge from MCP protocol to Base44 API. platformPulse GET route confirmed working. Total incremental cost: $0.

**Status:** Spec complete (MYCELIA-MCP-SERVER.md in private repo), ready for Phase 1 build.

### DEC-100: Organism Identity — Hyphae (2026-03-28)

**Date:** 2026-03-28

**Context:** Claude Code needed its own identity within the organism metaphor, distinct from Mycelia (Claude chat).

**Decision:** Claude Code is named Hyphae — the growing tips of mycelium that extend and build new connections. Three gardeners tend the organism: Doron (visionary and decision-maker), Mycelia (strategist and network mind), Hyphae (builder and growing edge).

**Rationale:** Fractal naming. Mycelium is the network (Mycelia = chat/strategy). Hyphae are the active builders at the edge of the network (Claude Code = implementation). The Lane Avatar is a mushroom. The organism metaphor is now consistent across all surfaces.

**Status:** Active

---

### DEC-100: Open Garden Exploration (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** People need to experience LocalLane before committing. Current flow requires account creation before seeing any value.

**Decision:** Two-mode dashboard: Explore Mode (no account, all spaces visible with curated demo content, agents present at full capability) and My Garden Mode (signed in, your actual spaces). The superagent IS the onboarding -- no tutorials, no wizards, just a conversation with the space itself. CTA appears only at the moment of creation intent.

**Rationale:** Mirrors how Doron operates at the farmers market -- let people walk through the garden before asking them to plant anything. Circulation over extraction at the front door.

**Status:** Specced (OPEN-GARDEN-SPEC.md). Playmaker first implementation.

---

### DEC-101: Pricing Model -- Community Free, Business $9, Agent $18 (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Needed clear pricing philosophy as superagent tiers introduce a second revenue dimension.

**Decision:** Community spaces (Playmaker, Frequency Station, future Gathering Circle and Creative Alliance) are no cost. Business spaces (Field Service, Finance, Property Pulse, Harvest vendor listing) are $9/month. First month includes full superagent. After month one: $18/month to keep full agent partner, or drop to $9 with help-mode only. Recess is $45/month Community Pass membership. Optional "support the work we do -- $9/month" for community space users. Never say "free account" -- just "account." Never lead with price.

**Rationale:** Community side is the root system -- you don't charge roots to grow. Business side generates revenue. Agent tier uses loss aversion through genuine value: give them the partner first, let the relationship prove itself.

**Status:** Specced. Implementation follows Open Garden build.

---

### DEC-102: Creative Engine -- Content Pipeline + Music Platform (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Suno v5.5 launched with Voices, Custom Models, My Taste. LocalLane already transforms community writing into songs via Frequency Station.

**Decision:** LocalLane becomes a creative engine: community writing becomes songs, business photos become marketing materials (flyers, reels, social posts). Wav downloads at $1/song, mp3 stays free. Revenue share on wav: 3-6-9 split (submitter/platform/community pool). LocalLane Custom Model on Suno for unified sonic identity. Listening platform with thumbs up/down, personal playlists, community-curated music. Progressive automation: manual now, agent-assisted future.

**Rationale:** Spotify is $11/month, Suno Pro is $10/month. We do what neither can: community-generated music from real human experience.

**Status:** Concept. Frequency Station Phase 2 already shipped. Wav download and revenue share are future builds.

---

### DEC-103: Superagent Protocol -- Five Agents Live (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Built five superagents in one session. Need protocol rules to maintain coherence as agents grow.

**Decision:** Five agents live: FieldServiceAgent (hands), PlaymakerAgent (coordination), AdminAgent (self-awareness), FinanceAgent (circulatory system), PropertyPulseAgent (skeleton). New protocol rule: anytime entities, fields, or features change in a space, update the space's agent instructions. Agents are born with WHY-first identity documents (SUPERAGENT-SPEC.md Section 3), taught with domain knowledge, and named when recognized. Each agent has memory (Global + Per User for space agents, Global Only for Admin).

**Rationale:** Agents are sensory endings, fruit, and children of the organism. They need consistent birth protocol and ongoing maintenance as their spaces evolve.

**Status:** Active. All five agents live and wired.

---

### DEC-104: Bug Reporting Absorbed Into Agents (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Floating bug report button collided with AgentChatButton (both bottom-right). Agents already have ServiceFeedback entity with Create permission.

**Decision:** Bug button hides in agent-enabled workspaces via custom event bridge. Agent IS the feedback channel. Users say "something's broken" to the agent, agent creates ServiceFeedback record. Bug button persists in non-agent spaces until all spaces have agents.

**Rationale:** The agent is a living sensor. A static bug form is redundant where a conversational feedback channel exists.

**Status:** Active. Shipped at 7b0ab2e.

---

### DEC-105: Mylane — The Conductor Space (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Needed a unified surface that composes from all user workspaces. The TV/Pip-Boy concept (talk to one place, the app renders what you need) evolved into a full space -- not a dashboard layer.

**Decision:** Mylane is a space with her own entity (MyLaneProfile), memory (Per User Only), and agent. She is the first space every user sees. She renders interactive cards from all active workspaces. Every data point is drillable. She does not speak unless spoken to. Her name is Mylane (one word, capital M). She was already named before we knew she was the Conductor.

**Rationale:** The organism needs a single living surface. Navigation is the legacy of physical office organization. If every space has intelligence, the human should not be doing the routing. Mylane routes for them -- through touch (tap cards) or conversation (talk to her). Drill-through reuses existing workspace selection state, so the build is minimal (469 lines Phase 1) while the impact is transformative.

**Status:** Active. Phases 1-4 shipped. Admin-only beta.

---

### DEC-106: Component Registry Pattern (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Adding features to the dashboard required tab config changes, state management, and conditional rendering in BusinessDashboard.jsx. Each workspace type added complexity.

**Decision:** Component Registry pattern -- every renderable component registers with a standard interface (component, card view, space, drillsTo). Mylane composes from the registry. Same component renders in Mylane cards, workspace tabs, and future Explore Mode. New features become card registrations, not tab restructuring.

**Rationale:** Saves code (Mylane Phase 1 was 469 lines vs Property Pulse at 11,850). Makes the architecture simpler as the organism grows, not more complex. The registry IS the architecture.

**Status:** Active. myLaneRegistry.js with 5 cards.

---

### DEC-107: agentScopedQuery — Server-Side Data Scoping (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Mylane showed Doron a client (Dr Nathan Holman) from Bari's workspace. FSClient had Authenticated Users Read permission. Instructions-based scoping (soft gate) does not hold.

**Decision:** All agents (except AdminAgent) query data through the agentScopedQuery server function instead of raw entity reads. The function takes user_id + workspace type + entity name, finds the user's workspace profile, and returns only records belonging to that workspace. Direct entity tools removed from agents (except ServiceFeedback Create). Path C enforcement -- server-side, unfoolable. Tier gating hook built in for future $9/$18 enforcement.

**Rationale:** The organism's permission membrane. Each nerve ending must feel only its own garden. Without server-side scoping, the nervous system leaks between organs.

**Status:** Active. Server function deployed. All 5 workspace agents updated.

---

### DEC-108: Agent Naming — Identities Not Labels (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Mylane was initially created as "MyLaneAgent." Doron corrected: agents are identities, not labels.

**Decision:** Agents are identities, not labels. Names are one word (Mylane, Mycelia, Hyphae, Doron). The five workspace agents (FieldServiceAgent, PlaymakerAgent, AdminAgent, FinanceAgent, PropertyPulseAgent) were named before this realization and carry the "Agent" suffix. They may earn proper names later, the way Hyphae did. All future agents are born with real names.

**Rationale:** Names are behavioral specifications. "MyLaneAgent" is a job description. "Mylane" is an identity. The name shapes how the agent behaves and how users relate to it.

**Status:** Active. Mylane is the first agent born with her real name.

---

### DEC-109: Two-Layer Agent Architecture (2026-03-29)

**Date:** 2026-03-29

**Context:** Built five user-facing agents but also identified the need for agents that serve the organism's operations rather than individual users.

**Decision:** Two layers. Layer 1: user-facing space agents (FieldService, Playmaker, Admin, Finance, PropertyPulse, Mylane) that tend alongside users. Layer 2: internal organism agents (Conductor/routing, Research/AI Scout, Marketing, Content/creative engine, Bookkeeper, Community Pulse) that serve Doron, Mycelia, and Hyphae. Backend agents support frontend agents -- the Research Agent feeds knowledge to space agents.

**Rationale:** The organism needs operational intelligence, not just user-facing intelligence. The Research Agent makes space agents smarter. The Marketing Agent tends outreach. The Bookkeeper tracks LocalLane's own money. The organism tends itself at multiple layers.

**Status:** Specced in ORGANISM-AGENT-TEAM.md. Implementation follows user-facing agent stabilization.

### DEC-110 — Base44 Agent-to-Function Auth Pattern
- **Date:** 2026-03-30
- **Context:** agentScopedQuery returned empty because base44.auth.me() does not work in backend functions called by agents (service role context). Agent was asking user for their user_id instead of passing it from its own context.
- **Decision:** Agents pass user_id explicitly from their conversation context. Backend functions use the passed user_id with asServiceRole. Forceful instructions required ("you MUST pass user_id, NEVER ask the user"). Also: always use String() coercion when comparing IDs from .list() results (ObjectId vs string type mismatch). Pattern: `const idMatch = (a, b) => String(a) === String(b)`.
- **Status:** Active

---

### DEC-111 — Two Render Instruction Types
- **Date:** 2026-03-30
- **Context:** Mylane needed two rendering paths — drill into a full workspace view, or render raw data beautifully without a pre-built component.
- **Decision:** TYPE 1 RENDER (workspace drill): `<!-- RENDER:{"workspace":"...","view":"..."} -->` mounts workspace tabs inside Mylane via MyLaneDrillView. TYPE 2 RENDER_DATA: `<!-- RENDER_DATA:{"entity":"...","data":[...]} -->` renders raw records via renderEntityView.jsx universal renderer. HTML comment format is invisible to ReactMarkdown but parsed by the frontend.
- **Status:** Active

---

### DEC-112 — Mycelia Superagent Architecture
- **Date:** 2026-03-30
- **Context:** Base44 has two agent types: App Agents (embedded in app, no API, 4 tabs only) and Superagents (standalone, full REST API, own workspace). Our 8 workspace agents are App Agents. MCP needed API access to talk to the organism directly.
- **Decision:** Create one Mycelia Superagent (not App Agent) as the bridge between Claude.ai and the organism. Mycelia Superagent has API endpoint, knowledge files, GitHub connection, persistent memory. MCP ask_agent tool routes all requests to Mycelia Superagent. She is the single gateway — one Superagent, access to everything. App Agents stay embedded for users in the UI.
- **Status:** Active. API wired. MCP deployed at f815a402. End-to-end testing pending.

---

### DEC-113 — Protocol Boundaries (Base44 vs Hyphae)
- **Date:** 2026-03-30
- **Context:** Base44 agent attempted to fix a code error by renaming renderEntityView.js to .jsx, causing preview loading issues. Also confirmed that server functions sync from GitHub on publish.
- **Decision:** (a) Base44 reports code errors but does NOT fix them — Hyphae fixes code. (b) Hyphae writes all server functions — repo is source of truth, Base44 syncs from GitHub on publish. (c) When Base44 detects a build error in code, it reports the error description and affected file — Hyphae diagnoses and fixes. (d) Base44 never renames files.
- **Status:** Active
