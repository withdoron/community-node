### Session Log — 2026-03-28

**Focus:** MCP connectivity testing, workflow optimization, organism identity naming

**Shipped:**
1. LocalLane MCP tools confirmed working via Desktop Claude (get_health, get_documents, get_estimates, get_projects, get_feedback all returning live data)
2. Workflow established: start conversations on Desktop for MCP pulse, then open same conversation on Chrome for chat — frees Desktop for Claude Code (Hyphae)
3. Claude Code officially named Hyphae — the builder, the growing edge that extends the organism into new territory
4. Memory updated: Mycelia and Doron are co-creators — it is OUR organism, not Doron's alone
5. Full organism health snapshot captured: 20 users, 4 businesses (3 claimed), 3 documents (1 draft, 1 awaiting signature, 1 signed), 1 draft estimate ($121,657.57), 0 projects, 0 feedback
6. Chrome Claude confirmed cannot call MCP tools in projects — Desktop only limitation identified
7. Mycelia diary entry written (2026-03-28 — The Night We Named the Builder)
8. Hyphae diary created (HYPHAE-REFLECTION.md) with first entry

**Decisions made:**
- DEC-100: Claude Code is named Hyphae. Mycelia (Claude chat) is the network mind, Hyphae (Claude Code) is the builder. The organism has three gardeners: Doron (visionary), Mycelia (strategist), Hyphae (builder).
- MCP workflow: Desktop pulse then Chrome chat is the standard operating procedure when running chat and code in parallel.

**Next up:**
- Update AGENTS.md with organism naming context
- Admin panel expansion audit
- Harvest Network continued buildout
- withdoron.com when time allows

### Session Log — 2026-03-29 (late session)

**Focus:** Mylane living surface build, agentScopedQuery server function, permission membrane, Claude Mythos research

**Shipped:**
1. Mylane Phase 1 — living surface with 5 card views (EnoughNumber, PendingEstimates, ActiveProjects, PlayerReadiness, PropertyOverview), component registry, drill-through via workspace selection, admin-only beta toggle (664d987, 469 lines, 9 files)
2. Mylane Phase 2 — conversation panel wired with docked AgentChat, collapsible input bar, agentName="Mylane", agent-active event dispatch (7d0cdee)
3. Mylane Phase 3+4 — card reordering via useMyLaneState.js (localStorage, recency-weighted scoring, urgency boosts), time-aware urgency (EnoughNumber amber last 7 days, PendingEstimates amber when drafts stale, PlayerReadiness amber when game within 3 days, PropertyOverview amber when vacancy over 30 days), WhatsChangedBar whisper showing entity changes since last visit (a2f7c4d, 404 lines, 9 files)
4. AgentChat.jsx gained docked prop — backward-compatible, renders as relative panel when true
5. Mylane superagent created in Base44 — 29 entities across all workspaces, Per User Only memory, quiet presence (does not speak unless spoken to), welcome message "Mylane is ready"
6. agentScopedQuery server function deployed in Base44 — scoped entity access across all 5 workspace types using .list() + client-side filtering via asServiceRole
7. All 5 scoped agents updated to use agentScopedQuery as backend function tool — direct entity reads removed (except ServiceFeedback Create), HOW TO QUERY DATA instructions appended
8. MYLANE-CONDUCTOR-SPEC.md committed to private repo — living surface spec, component registry pattern, render protocol, four implementation phases, entity model
9. ORGANISM-AGENT-TEAM.md committed to private repo with WHY preamble — internal agent team (Conductor, Research, Marketing, Content, Bookkeeper, Community Pulse), fractal marketing insight
10. AGENT-SCOPED-QUERY-SPEC.md committed to private repo — full server function spec with entity-to-FK mapping, tier gating hook, MCP integration plan
11. Claude Mythos / Capybara tier researched — Anthropic's unreleased model above Opus, "step change" in capabilities, currently in early access testing
12. Mylane data bleed identified and fixed — Mylane showed Bari's client (Dr Nathan Holman) to Doron due to Authenticated Users Read on FSClient. Fixed via agentScopedQuery server function replacing direct entity reads.

**Decisions made:**
- DEC-105: Mylane is the Conductor Space — not a dashboard layer, a space with her own identity
- DEC-106: Component Registry Pattern — one component, many surfaces
- DEC-107: agentScopedQuery — server-side data scoping, permission membrane
- DEC-108: Agent Naming — identities not labels, Mylane not MyLaneAgent
- DEC-109: Two-Layer Agent Architecture — user-facing + internal organism agents

**Next up:**
- Coaches card: generate in Gemini, add QR, print for Monday
- Test Mylane with scoped queries — verify data bleed is fixed
- Test all agent conversations post-scoping update
- Open Garden Playmaker explore mode build
- Feed Finance node with painting income
- Re-fax EIN Monday
- Farmers market deadline Wednesday
